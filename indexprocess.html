        For this concept project I will re-design my Javascript final website using
        flex-box, clean compositions, better color choices, as well
        as improve the functionality of the website's logic. I will detail each step
        of my process of re-designing and planning my journey of bettering this previous
        project.

          When I was in Community College of Philadelphia, I took a Javascript class as an
          introduction to Web Development. New to HTML, CSS, Javascript, I had to create a
          Final Project using all the elements. Although the website served its purpose
          I wanted to take it further after a year since the Javascript class. The photo shown
          is my final project from Spring 2018.

        For this phase, I briefly plan out exactly how I want to structure the website by
        creating low-resolution prototypes. Since this is a personal archive page that has little
        Information and selected photos, I wanted to use a more simple and clean design that
        focuses on the selected photos that year.

    <div id="test-text">
      After finalizing my low-res prototypes, I created a trial verison for User Testing.
      The main concern from my peers were to make the sections more clearly defined
      in the final verisons and use different compositions to prevent it from looking similar.
